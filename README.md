# ðŸŽ¬ Movie-Web

https://jindun-movie-web.vercel.app/home

Movie-Web is a web application built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript** that allows users to explore movies and TV shows. The app fetches data from **TMDB** (The Movie Database), a free and open-source RESTful API, and displays it in an organized and user-friendly way. All data is fetched server-side for better performance, and **Recoil** is used for efficient state management to optimize resource usage.
